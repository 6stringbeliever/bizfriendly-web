Why are we building it?
Charged with the topic of economic development, the Code for America fellows conducted a research and ideation process and discovered a need for improving digital literacy in Kansas City as means to economic development. 

Kansas City has an amazing business community with over 48,000 small businesses. That’s a 26th-place ranking among the nation’s 938 metropolitan and micropolitan areas! Kansas City also has a digital advantage by becoming one of the most Internet-connected cities in the country through Google Fiber and other local initiatives, such as Connecting for Good. 

But amongst Kansas Citians, there’s a drop off in web skills beyond the very basics. <image of chart - on github> 
There’s room for improvement to to make Kansas City small business owners the most digitally literate in the country and BizFriendly will help achieve that.
