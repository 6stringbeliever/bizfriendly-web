    <h2>Why are we building it?</h2>
    <p>Charged with the topic of economic development, the Code for America fellows conducted <a href="http://cfakc.tumblr.com/process">a research and ideation process</a> and discovered a need for improving digital literacy in Kansas City as means to economic development.</p>

    <p>Kansas City has an amazing business community with over <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/blog/2012/07/kansas-city-ranks-26th-for-small.html">48,000 small businesses</a>. That’s a 26th-place ranking among the nation’s 938 metropolitan and micropolitan areas! Kansas City also has a digital advantage by becoming one of the most Internet-connected cities in the country through <a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/">Google Fiber</a> and other local initiatives, such as <a href="http://www.connectingforgood.org/">Connecting for Good</a>.</p>

    <p>But amongst Kansas Citians, there’s a drop off in web skills beyond the very basics.<p>
    <img src="img/digital-skills-chart.png" class="img-responsive">
    <p>There’s room for improvement to to make Kansas City small business owners the most digitally literate in the country and BizFriendly will help achieve that.</p>
